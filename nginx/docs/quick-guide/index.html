        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to Predico, a Collaborative Forecasting Platform initiative designed to enhance forecasting accuracy through collaboration between market makers and forecasters.
            In its current form, this platform consists exclusively of an API server, with no front-end available. Therefore, every interaction is done via HTTP requests.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="definitions">
        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Maker:</strong> An entity that owns resources (e.g., wind farms) or manages a grid (e.g., a TSO) and seeks forecasts by opening and funding collaborative forecasting market sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Forecaster:</strong> An individual or organization registered in the platform, aiming to submit forecasts to collaborative forecasting challenges opened by the Market Maker, competing for the available prize money in each session.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Session:</strong> A specific period during which Market Makers can create forecasting challenges, and Forecasters can submit forecasts for the open challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Challenge:</strong> An opportunity, published by the Market Maker, with meta-data regarding a forecasting challenge that Forecasters can try to submit forecasts for.</li>
            <li><strong>Gate Closure Time:</strong> The deadline by which forecasts must be submitted for a market session.</li>
            <li><strong>Forecast Variables:</strong> Quantities to be forecasted, such as quantile 10, 50, 90, and conditional mean.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensemble Forecast:</strong> An aggregate forecast computed from multiple forecastersâ€™ submissions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h3>Important</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This platform is a proof of concept, so there might be changes to improve the outcomes for all parties</li>

        <h3>Collaborative Forecasting Sessions</h3>
        <p>
            Below, you can find a sequence diagram illustrating the dynamics of a collaborative forecasting session, which is generally organized in three separate phases.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> A new market session is scheduled to open.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Market Makers post new challenges, such as submitting day-ahead forecasts for specific assets (aka resources) in their portfolio.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Forecasters log into Predico API, download raw measurements data, build their models, and submit forecasts.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Forecasters log into Predico API, preview their skill scores and contribution importance to the final ensemble forecasts, to be delivered to the Market Maker.</li>
