# Forecaster Application

To participate in the Predico collaborative forecasting sessions, interested forecasters must complete an application process. 
This ensures that all participants meet the necessary criteria and are properly onboarded to contribute effectively to the platform.

!!! info "Registration"

    Forecasters apply to participate by sending an email to [predico@elia.be](mailto:predico@elia.be).  
    **Upon acceptance by Elia**, they receive a registration link to complete their registration.

!!! warning "Important"
    - **Serious Applicants Only**: Only serious applications will be considered. Forecasters' submitted forecasts should perform as well as or better than Elia's current forecast, published on Elia's Open Data Portal (https://opendata.elia.be/). Elia may request a one-day, day-ahead forecast before enrolling the Forecaster to verify seriousness.
    - **Single Forecaster ID**: For now, a maximum of one account can be issued per individual or organization wanting to participate as a Forecaster.
